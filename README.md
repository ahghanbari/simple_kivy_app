### Allright, it's time to explanation :dizzy_face:

In this bunch of code, we want to divide a list of Cards with Specific value between bob and potrick in the fairest way.

The Algorithm Part of that is too simple :flushed: :grin: You can see and Understand.

The GUI Part of that written with [kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) and it's difficult to explain, you can read that and if you could understand, then good for you :wink: :sunglasses:

### How to Use:
#### Requirements
Just kivy
```bash
pip3 install kivy
```
#### GNU/Linux Distribution:
first way <br />
```shell
python3 main.py
```
second way
```sh
./main.py
```

#### Windows
```python
python3 main.py
```

PS: we could put the file in the diffrent directory for more arrangement, but running that in the Unix-like system and widows was getting hard.

And in the end, this code was my project in the Algorithm Design Lesson.
