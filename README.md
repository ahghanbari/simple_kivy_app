### Allright, it's time to explanation :dizzy_face:

In this bunch of code, we want to divide a list of Cards with Specific value between bob and potrick in the fairest way.

The Algorithm Part of that is too simple :flushed: :grin: You can see and Understand.

The GUI Part of that written with [kivy](https://kivy.org/#home) and it's difficult to explain, you can read that and if you could understand, then good for you :wink: :sunglasses:

and in the end, this code was my project in the Algorithm Design Lesson.
